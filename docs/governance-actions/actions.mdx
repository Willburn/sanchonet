| 1. Motion of no-confidence                                          | A motion to create a _state of no-confidence_ in the current constitutional committee |
| 2. New constitutional committee and/or threshold and/or term limits | Modifications to the members of the constitutional committee, signature threshold, or term limits|
| 3. Updates to the constitution                                      | Modifications to the off-chain constitution, recorded as an on-chain hash of the text document |
| 4. Hard fork initiation                                         | A non-backward compatible upgrade of the network, which requires a prior software upgrade |
| 5. Protocol parameter changes                                       | Any change to **one or more** updatable protocol parameters, excluding changes to major protocol versions ('hard forks') |
| 6. Treasury withdrawals                                             | Treasury withdrawals are sub-categorized into small, medium, or large and are determined by the amount of lovelace to be withdrawn. |
| 7. Info                                                             | An action that doesn't have any on-chain impact except for being recorded on-chain. |

Each type of governance action represents a distinct feature within cardano-node and cardano-cli. As such, they will be rolled out in phases, coinciding with the integration of each feature.
