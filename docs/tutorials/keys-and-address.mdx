First, generate a payment key pair and a stake key pair. Then, use the payment verification key and the stake verification key to build an address which can be used to receive funds from the faucet.

The payment keys control the funds, while the stake keys control the participation in the protocol: delegating stake to a pool and delegating votes to a delegate representative.

### Pre-requisites

### Generate key pairs

1. Generate payment keys:

```
cardano-cli conway address key-gen \
--verification-key-file payment.vkey \

2. Generate stake keys:

```
cardano-cli conway stake-address key-gen \
--verification-key-file stake.vkey \
--signing-key-file stake.skey
```

### Build the address
